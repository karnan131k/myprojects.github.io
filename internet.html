                    <p>The Internet is generally defined as <em>
                        a global network connecting millions of computers
                    </em>. More than 190 countries are linked into exchanges of data, news and opinions.

                    <p>
                        Unlike online services, which are centrally controlled, by design, the Internet is decentralized. 
                        Each Internet computer, called a <em>host</em>, is independent. Operators can choose which Internet 
                        services to use and which local services to make available to the global community. Remarkably, this 
                        anarchy by design works exceedingly well. There are a variety of ways to access the Internet. Most 
                        online services offer access to some Internet services. It is also possible to gain access through a 
                        commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP).

                        The <em>Internet</em> is <strong>not</strong> synonymous with <em>World Wide Web</em>
                        The Internet is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure. It connects millions of computers
                         together globally, forming a network in which any computer can communicate with any other computer as 
                         long as they are both connected to the Internet. The World Wide Web, or simply Web, is a way of accessing 
                         information over the medium of the Internet. It is an information-sharing model that is built on top of the 
                         Internet.

                         entirety. The Internet is more of a concept than an actual tangible entity, and it relies on a 
                         physical infrastructure that connects networks to other networks.
